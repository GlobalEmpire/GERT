-- Tested with GERTi v1.2
-- This provides a very simple chat program between 3 GERTi Clients to demonstrate network functionality. If communication between only two computers is desired, please comment out lines 8, 11, 24-25, 31, and 35. 
-- The GERTi addresses must be configured manually as this is a very simple program. The UI is terrible, but a better chat program can be found at https://github.com/GlobalEmpire/OC-Programs/tree/master/Programs/OpenChat
