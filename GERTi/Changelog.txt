Lots of bugfixes


v0.9.2
Changed:
1. Replaced previous system of attempting to use a single connection for bi-directional data transfer. Now GERTi automatically adds and utilizes two uni-directional connections.

3. Replaced long if...elseif chain in receive packet in Client/Gateway with new handler system
4. Replaced modem/tunnel checking system with a new one (Credit to Kodos for that), and centralized modem setup code.

Added:

2. Improved quality and quantity of documentation
3. New packet handler table system to improve speed of client and gateway, and reduce code complexity
