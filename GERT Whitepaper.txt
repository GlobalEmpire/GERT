1. Introduction
It's important to decide on a standard networking implementation to allow for maximum compatibility and ease of use. 
GERT is simple, smart, and powerful, which helped it to become THE Ocranet routing implementation!
GERTe is an inter-server networking standard built to maximize the potential of Ocranet, 
while GERTi is an infra-server networking bringing enterprise grade failure tolerance and end-user simplicity right into your OC
computer.

2. Compatibility.
GERTe (e for external) can be made compatible with any infra-server networking technology, as long as it is Ocranet/GERTe network
addressing aware. GERTi (i for internal) can also be made compatible with any inter-server networking technology, as long as it is
Ocranet/GERTi network addressing aware.

3. Technical Terminology
A. Ocranet: The base networking protocol GERT is built on. To ensure a minimum level of compatibility, this should be used as the inter
server networking standard.
B. Gateway: An OpenComputers computer with an internet card that is responsible from connecting an interior infra-server network to an
external inter-server (preferably Ocranet based) network.
C. GERT: The complete Global Empire Routing Technology package. This includes a network that has both a GERTi network+gateway and a
GERTe gateway. It may also be referred to as GERTc for clarity.
D. GERTe: The Global Empire Routing Technology external implementation. This is solely for communication outside a minecraft, and
handles gateway to gateway communication.
E. GERTi: The Global Empire Routing Technology internal implementation. This is solely for communication inside a minecraft server using
OC equipment.
F. GEDS: Global Empire Domain Server. Translates GERTe "phone numbers" to IP addresses and handles TCP networking outside of a minecraft
server
G. End-user: an OC computer that is connected to a gateway.
H. Cell: An Ocranet packet.

4. GERTe operation
  A. Premise
    Global Empire Routing Technology external is designed to provide the routing implementation for Ocranet with maximum flexibility, 
    and minimal routing overhead.
    
  B. Implementation Overview
    Ocranet is built on using "telephone" style numbers to allow minecraft servers to communicate with each other. GERTe specifies a way
    to turn that "telephone" number into a real connection. By communicating with a GENS server at the beginning of a new connection
    with a server, it internally translates the entered "telephone" number into a real-world IP address for direct communications.
    
  C. Gateway Implementation Details
    Startup Procedure:
    Upon startup, the Ocranet gateway downloads a real-world IP address list of GENS servers.
      1a. If download fails, throw error
      1b. If download succeeds, continue
    
    Operating procedure:
    1. A GERTe gateway receives a request to contact a server with a "telephone" number and, optionally, a port number.
    2. The GERTe gateway contacts a GENS server chosen randomly from the list.
      2a. If the GEDS server is successfully contacted, proceed to step 4.
      2b. If the GEDS server is unsuccessfully contacted, begin trying servers in succession from top to bottom.
      2c. If no GEDS server is reachable, throw error.
    3. The GERTE gateway requests that the GEDS server lookup the "telephone" number and return the real-world IP address of the     
    number.
      3a. If the GEDS server cannot find the "telephone" number, throw error
      3b. If the GEDS server returns the real-world IP address, store internally for use.
    4. The GERTe gateway attempts to contact the other GERTe gateway on either the port number provided, or the standard contact    
    port number (tbd).
      4a. If the end-point cannot be contacted, try up to 5 attempts.
      4b. If the end-point proves unreachable, throw error
      4c. If the end-point is contacted, continue.
    5. The GERTe starting gateway transfers data as requested over the connection, and maintains the connection until requested, or
    30 minutes elapse.
    6. Upon request, the GERTe gateway transmits a close signal and then closes the connection.
	
  D. GEDS implementation details
    1. Maintain table of "telephone" number and key pairs.
    2. Upon request from a new gateway, receive a address key pair for registration, or is a peer:
      2a. If the gateway sends a valid pair, assign that address to the gateway and proceed to 3.
      2b. If the gateway sends an invalid pair continue at step 2.
	  2c. If the connection is a known peer, continue to step 6.
    3. Transmit to peers the registration of the gateway for routing.
    4. Upon data request, check that the gateway is registered and continue.
      4a. If the destination is connected to this GEDS, replace destination with source and forward to the destination.
      4b. If the destination is connected to a different known GEDS, add the source into the packet and forward to remote GEDS.
	  4c. If the route to the destination is not known or does not exist, respond with an error.
	5. Loop step 4 until connection is closed.
	6. If the peer sends a peer update command:
		6a. If the command adds a peer, add it to the known list.
		6b. If the command removes a peer, remove it from the known list.
	7. If the peer sends a key update command:
		7a. If the command adds a key, add it to the key address pair list.
		7b. If the command removes a key, remove it from the key address pair list.
	8. If a peer sends a registration update command:
		8a. If the command adds a registration, mark it as the remote route for a gateway.
		8b. If the command removes a registration, remove it from the remote routes.
	9. If a peer sends a data route packet, transmit it to the registered gateway.
	10. Loop to step 6.
	
  E. GERTi integration details
  Transmission Side:
    1. GERTi makes use of a 3-digit extension code to a GERTe "telephone" number, so monitor all outgoing requests for the 3 digit
    code.
    2. Upon recognition of extended length number, strip the last 3 digits from connection initation request, and use the extended
    format cell when in communication with the destination.
  Reception Side:
    1. Strip the 3-digit extension code from Ocranet extended format cell.
    2. Pass the code and data on to GERTi gateway.
    
5. GERTi Operation
  A. Premise
    GERTi provides a simple, distributed, powerful, network for OC computers inside of a minecraft server. GERTi handles the networking
    of OC computers to each other, and when enabled by an appropriate protocol (e.g. GERTe) can connect to computers outside of a
    minecraft server.
    
  B. Implementation overview
    Upon startup, a GERTi enabled computer will use all available communication channels to attempt to reach a gateway through up to 2
    intermediate computers. This currently allows for up to 1,000 clients on any GERTi network.
    
  C. Implementation details
    Startup:
    1. Upon startup, a GERTi enabled computer checks for tunnel cards and wired/wireless network cards.
    2. If it has a linked card, attempt to check for a GERTi computer on the other end.
      2a. If the other computer has GERTi and is Tier 0 (gateway)/Tier 1/Tier 2, store the other computer's network card UUID, store the
      other computer's tier, and set this computer's tier to other computer's tier+1. Advance to step 3.
      2b. If the other computer is not GERTi enabled, do nothing and advance to 3.
    3. If it has a wired/wireless card, do a broadcast on port 4378 to look for GERTi enabled computers.
      3a. For each reply that is from a computer with GERTi and is a gateway(Tier 0)/Tier 1/Tier 2, store the other computer's network
      card UUID, and store the other computer's tier. Advance to 4
      3b. If no response from any other computer, advance to 4.
    4. Sort table entries by computers' GERTi tier.
    5. Set this computer's tier to that of the lowest GERTi channel number's tier plus 1.
    6. Engage listener so that other computers that send out broadcasts can connect through this computer.
      6a. On startup message reception, reply with computer Tier number, network card UUID, if this computer is tier 0/1/2.
    7. Forward local database connections up through chain to gateway.
    
    Communication
    1. Upon inter-server communication requests from within the computer, attempt to connect to gateway, either directly, or through the
    highest ranked parent node.
      1a. If gateway acknowledges connection, forward data through it, and out of the network.
      1b. If gateway does not respond, report an error.
    2. Upon inter-server communication request from a child node, follow step 1.
    3. Upon infra-server communication request from within the computer, attempt to lookup target network card UUID in local database.
      3a. If UUID is found, transmit directly, skip rest of 3.
      3b. If UUID is not found, request parent node to look up UUID in its local database.
      3c. If parent does not respond, report error.
    4. Upon infra-server communication request from a child node, attempt to lookup target network card UUID in local database.
      4a. If UUID is found, attempt to open connection to network card, and notify child of success.
      4b. If UUID is not found, request parent node to look up UUID in its local database.
      4c. If parent does not respond, report error.
   D. GERTi Gateway operation
    Startup:
    1. Register event listener to listen for new clients.
    2. Attempt to connect to external routing protocol (GERTe preferred, but not necessary)
    3. Collect and organize routing table and paths to every child node.
    
    Communication:
    1. Upon infra-server communication request from a child node, look up most efficient (fewest hops) path to requested node.
      1a. If path found and verified, route communication to destination
      1b. If no paths found, report error.
    2. Upon inter-server communication request from a child node, prepare Ocranet cell for transmission to external routing protocol.
	2a. If external protocol not available, send FAIL cell.
